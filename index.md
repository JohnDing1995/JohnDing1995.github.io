Iâ€™m a master student from Aalto University/TU Delft (joint double degree program, organised by the [EIT Digital Master School](https://masterschool.eitdigital.eu/)), major in Cloud Computing and Services.

From Feb. 2020, I'm a Junior DevOps Consultant at <a href='https://www.eficode.com/'>Eficode</a> (Helsinki, Finland). I'm also working on my master thesis at the moment.

My expertise is in backend development, cloud computing and DevOps. You could find my CV [here](https://ruiyang.rocks/files/cv.pdf).
