Iâ€™m an actively first-year master student from Aalto University, major in Cloud Computing and
Services. From April 2019, I also work as a full-time microservice and backend developer at <a href='https://apluslms.github.io'>A+ LMS</a>.

 I identify myself as a team player who is outgoing and open-minded to all
kinds of culture or people, with a strong curiosity and ability in learning new things. My past job
and project brings me rich experiences in back-end development( Python or Node.js) and C++
development.
